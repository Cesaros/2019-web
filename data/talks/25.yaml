talk_abstract: "Since Python 3.5 and PEP 492, we have been able to write asynchronous programs in an easy and Pythonic way without external libraries. Even so, it is still difficult to understand what asynchronous programming is all about and when we, Python developers, should consider using it.

This talk will give you a gentle introduction to the world of asynchronous programming, focusing mostly on the core concept of async programming, how it works, and what its applications are, in order to provide a good foundation to Python developers on the topic. On top of that, we will explore a small code example (mostly involving the built-in `asyncio`) and briefly exam the source code of CPython to find out how it works. This talk will also give you some brief comparison of `threading.Thread` and `ThreadPoolExecutor`."
