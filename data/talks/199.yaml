talk_abstract: "Sometimes you need to scale the performance of your Python code, or you need to hook into a C API.  Wouldn't it be nice not having to do that in C or C++? This talk walks through how to accelerate Python code using a binding written in Rust (a new safe, fast systems level programming language)."
