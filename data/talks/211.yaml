talk_abstract: "# Description

This talk is a destructive examination of the workings of Python's inheritance model. We'll learn how it works by breaking it. By breaking inheritance in various ways, we will learn about the hooks that Python gives us to interact with it. These include using the metaclass to alter the class during construction, as well as using the \_\_init_subclass\_\_ and \_\_subclass\_\_ hooks.

Particular examples will include:

* Implementing interfaces in Python
* Turning inheritance off in favor of explicit reuse
* Simplifying classes by disabling a selection of features you don't wish to use

While none of these are meant to be particularly useful implementations, they make good use cases to show the machinery."
