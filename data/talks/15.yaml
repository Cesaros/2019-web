talk_abstract: "We have always been taught that the future you book a flight, the cheaper it is. What if I said it is not? You see it's a straight line and it has a minimum at some point (someday before the flight). We are going to see how historical Airfare data can help you get the best deals for you.

The talk on the whole process, from the data, to a basic neural network on the data. With advancements in deep learning in these few years, it is very easy to train a simple statistical model to predict the prices."
