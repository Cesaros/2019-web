talk_abstract: |
  Writing code in a Jupyter Notebook is an interactive process involving a lot of trial and error. As your code evolves, errors and bugs inevitably start to creep in. A debugger can help track them down. In this talk, we’ll go through some reasons why you may want to debug your notebook. Then, we’ll explore how you can debug notebooks with the ipdb debugger. Finally, we’ll see how we can use an IDE to track down those pesky bugs.  Questions such as 'How do you debug code in a Jupyter Notebook?' and 'Can I edit and run the cells until I get what I intended?' will be explored.
