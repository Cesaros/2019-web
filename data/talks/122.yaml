talk_abstract: "Susan Li walks you through deep learning methods for natural language processing (NLP) tasks using Python and open source libraries, using a live example. Methods include word2vec embedding, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). This is a hands-on approach to framing a real-world problem to the underlying NLP tasks and building a NLP application using Deep Learning. If you are a data scientist or software developer with experience in Python who wants to develop natural language processing software, this talk is for you."
