talk_abstract: "In this workshop we will go hands on with container workflows for Python developers. Expect something for everyone -- whether you are looking to containerize your first Python application, already run your own Kubernetes cluster, need to wrangle mountains of ML, or prefer \"CI/CD to do it for me\". Let's explore how containers and the cloud can make hard things easy and developers more productive with real-world scenarios and techniques that you will start using today."
