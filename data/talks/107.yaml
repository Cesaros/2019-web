talk_abstract: "Container orchestration has made choosing an operating environment for your application a much less apprehensive decision. There are now multiple abstraction layers available that take the fear out of vendor lock in, and make the commitment to a vendor much more palatable. Specifically, Kubernetes has provided developers a consistent cloud-agnostic interface with which to deploy applications and has achieved critical mass as the orchestration solution of choice. However all solutions bring with them new challenges- and this is no exception. Before taking the leap, it's essential to have some idea of the complexity involved. As a developer interested in both Django and containers, it seemed prudent to me to evaluate Kubernetes as a production platform. Here's some of the twists and hidden caveats, (as well as the pleasantries) of working with this orchestration solution."
