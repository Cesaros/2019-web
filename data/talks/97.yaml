talk_abstract: "Want to take your career to the next level? Aren’t sure you’re doing what it takes to grow? In this talk we’ll discuss how the attitudes of curiosity (learning for the sake of learning), bravery (following your fears), dissatisfaction (discontentment as motivation for improvement) and reflection (taking time to absorb what you’ve learned) can help you continually grow and level up."
