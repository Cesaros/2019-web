talk_abstract: "Want to take your career to the next level? Aren’t sure you’re doing what it takes to grow? In this talk we’ll discuss how the attitudes of curiosity (learning for the sake of learning), bravery (following your fears), dissatisfaction (discontentment as motivation for improvement) and reflection (taking time to absorb what you’ve learned) can help you continually grow and level up."

about_author: "Leta Montopoli has spent the last four years at Security Compass working as a software developer on their product, SD Elements. Leta’s love for learning and taking on new challenges brought her to McGill University where she received her MSc in Mathematics. She began her computer science career after being accepted into the Recurse Center in New York City, an institution that provided a safe and supportive space to dive into whatever programming projects piqued her curiosity. In her spare time, Leta likes to hike, rock climb, read, and perform improv comedy."
