talk_abstract: "The ORM is a powerful and vital part of Django. It is simple and intuitive, but often some of the features are unutilized, leading to inefficiencies. In this cookbook style session, a selection of nontrivial query usecases will be presented, each introducing an ORM feature. Features covered are- advanced querying techniques, database functions, performance optimization, and legacy databases. It will be an interactive session and participants are encouraged to share knowledge and ask questions based on real-life experiences. The tutorial will end with a discussion on recent and upcoming ORM features."
