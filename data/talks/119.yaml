talk_abstract: "Municipal departments all work together for the common good of our residents through our strategic plan, but we may not always be up to date on what other staff or departments are working on. The Planning Services department of the Municipality of Clarington has utilized in house expertise and infrastructure to build several apps that allow our department and other departments within the Municipality to view our current workload, collaborate on projects and stay organized.

Three apps that have been the most successful at helping the departments work together will be demoed. The **Planning Applications Portal**, a portal that shows the ongoing planning applications at the municipality with reports and statistics. The **GIS Portal** that is used by the GIS professionals of the Municipality to stay organized, establish governance, collaborate and share with each other. Thirdly, the **Geospatial Data Inventory** which is a massive database of all the geospatial data that the Municipality manages, including visualization, data requests and metadata.
After the brief demos we will walk through how to build one of these at your organization. They are all built with Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
