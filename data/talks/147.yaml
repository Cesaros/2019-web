talk_abstract: "Our entire world wide web already is composed of linked data. In this talk we will demonstrate how python module RDFlib is able to traverse and parse linked data. As we will learn in this talk, linked data is queried with a query language called SPARQL which is supported by the RDFlib library. We will also show you how to level up your data insights by introducing graph databases. By the end of this talk you will be able to see for yourself draw relationships out of open linked data, as well as the unique value of communicating the relationships from linked data."
