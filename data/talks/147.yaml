talk_abstract: "Our entire world wide web already is composed of linked data, and so it is not surprising that cultural institutions such as libraries, archives and museums - organizations which provide and curate open data - have begun to transform their metadata into linked data.  In this talk we will explain why linked data is powerful and demonstrate the process of how to extract data insights from it using the python modules RDFlib and plotly. 

RDFlib is a powerful library used for working with triple data and representing information. As we will learn in this talk, linked data is queried with a query language called SPARQL which is supported by the RDFlib library. We’ll move from parsing data and then bring out your inner artist with plotly to create visualizations. The plot will thicken when we briefly touch upon how machine learning can be applied to linked data and the ways in which working with linked metadata is different and has unique promises not present in other forms of linked data. 
By the end of this talk you will be able to see for yourself how to draw relationships out of open linked data and the vale of communicating the relationships visible in linked data."

about_author: "Rachel Wang is a Software Developer and Pythonista at the University of Toronto Libraries. She regularly uses Python to support ETL and data heavy tasks at the library. When away from the keyboard she enjoys helping others learn technical skills as an instructor with the Software Carpentry community. Rachel is also a co-organizer for a meetup called Code4Lib Toronto which brings together communities from libraries, museums, archives and technology all in one room. When she isn’t using Python, Golang and Vue.js are always on her mind. You can find her @rwangca. 

Hey, I'm Jordan, metadata librarian at the University of Toronto libraries, and enthusiastic newbie to python. I am a certified Carpentries instructor, regular participant at Code4Lib Toronto, and huge proponent of the connection between tech and creativity. I also love to balance my technically-focused work life with non-technical things, like hiking, doodling, and hanging out with animals (specifically cows, chickens and llamas)."
