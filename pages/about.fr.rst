    Our main goal is to strengthen the Canadian Python community by providing more opportunities 
    for us to share knowledge and ideas, encourage support and education for speaking at 
    conferences, and increase the visibility of developers, organizations, and companies 
    within the community.
    <br /><br />
    PyCon Canada is entirely run by volunteers who are passionate about these goals. We hope to 
    see you at the 2019 conference! We\'re also proud to host development sprints which provide 
    a gateway for new contributors and a way for you to give back to the open-source community.
    On November 18-19, please join us at The Carlu, Torontoâ€™s premier event conference center 
    in downtown Toronto.
