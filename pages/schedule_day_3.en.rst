  <h2>Sprints November 18-19 2019</h2>

  <p>PyCon Canada Development Sprints are two days of intensive learning and development on an open source project of your choice, in a team environment. It's a time to come together with colleagues, old and new, to share what you've learned and apply it to an open source project.</p>

  <p>They will be held at the Mozilla Toronto (366 Adelaide St W Suite 500). <br/>

  Though sprints are a part of the conference, we ask that all those who wish to participate to <a href ="https://pyconca2019-sprint-days.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">register here</a>.</p>

  <p>PyCon provides the space and infrastructure (network, power, tables & chairs); you bring your skills, humanity, and brainpower (oh! and don't forget your computer).</p>
