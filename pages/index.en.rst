    PyCon Canada is a community conference intended for networking and 
    collaboration in the developer community.
    <br /><br />
    We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want 
    all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, 
    all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees 
    throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially 
    sponsored by PyCon Canada or not.
    <br /><br />
    To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and 
    volunteers at any PyCon Canada event are required to conform to the 
    following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout 
    the event.
